    <p class="mb-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlog">Backlog</a>, a thing that is essential for maintaining
    your tasks that need to be done. I myself am very bad at keeping up with videogames that I want to play so
    I decided that the prefect course project would be a videogame backlog. Hopefully this application proves
    to be some use to someone. In truth a backlog is probably something that is more easily maintained in a
    spreadsheet, but a sufficiently advanced application can prove to be even more useful!</p>
