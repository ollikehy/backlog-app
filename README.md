## Videogame backlog
This was a course work for the course [tietokantasovellus](https://materiaalit.github.io/tsoha-18/) (loosely translated = database application) at the University of Helsinki

### Introduction
The subject of the work is an application that allows you to create a backlog for videogames. With the application the user can follow which video games he has not yet played, that he wants to play. The user can go through a list of videogames and sort them by name or release year. Every user can add to the common list of video games. The user can add to his own personsal backlog from the common list, after which the user can mark the games they've played completed.
